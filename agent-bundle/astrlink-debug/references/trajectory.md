# Request trajectory

`events[]` on a request record is the gateway pipeline. Read it in order.

| kind        | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `accepted`  | Local inference accepted the request and assigned an id                                                                                                                      |
| `privacy`   | Request privacy policy ran (`allow`, `warn`, `block`, or `redact`)                                                                                                           |
| `routed`    | Route / `astrlink/auto` category and target were chosen                                                                                                                      |
| `upstream`  | The selected service was invoked                                                                                                                                             |
| `restore`   | Privacy placeholders were restored on the way back                                                                                                                           |
| `completed` | Terminal status written (`succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `blocked`). Failures use `error.code ·` the unwrapped transport cause (host/URL allowed; credentials redacted). |

Retries appear as **child** records (`parent_request_id` set).
`get_request_children` lists them. The root keeps `child_count` and the
successful or last-failed outcome.

Useful session fields:

- `session_id` groups requests from one client conversation
- `turn_index` is the 1-based **user turn**. Every model call of one agent loop
  (tool call → tool result → next call) shares the same value, so a session
  summary reads `1 turn · 8 calls`. It is relative, not a count: the first
  record of a session is turn 1 however many `role=user` messages its history
  holds (harnesses replay skill text and compaction summaries as user messages),
  and a linked record starts a new turn only when it has more user messages than
  the record it links to (`turn_user_messages`) or its newest user text changed
  (`turn_user_fingerprint`). `null` means the protocol has no user turns
  (completions) or the row predates linking.
- `session_link` tells how the record joined its session; `null` means it
  started the session. `kind` is one of:
  - `explicit` — the client named the conversation (`previous_response_id`,
    `conversation`, `metadata.session_id`, Claude Code session,
    `prompt_cache_key`, Anthropic `container`, Gemini `cachedContent`). Matched
    across tokens.
  - `echo_id` — the request replayed an opaque id an earlier response produced
    (tool call ids, Responses item ids, Gemini thought signatures). Matched only
    within the same access token and a 7-day window.
  - `fingerprint` — the request replayed the last assistant reply verbatim;
    linked by a keyed digest of the normalized text (≥ 32 runes). Same scope as
    `echo_id`.
- `cursors[]` are the typed values stored for the record (`kind`, `direction`
  `in`/`out`, `value`). `out` rows are what this record's response produced (its
  output id, minted tool call ids, reply fingerprint) and are what later
  requests link to. `in` rows are only the explicit cursors the request named;
  replayed tool ids and reply digests are lookup keys and are not stored, so
  look at `session_link` for the one that matched. Fingerprint values are HMAC
  digests and cannot be reversed to text.
- `previous_response_id` / `output_response_id` are the legacy protocol cursor
  columns; `previous_response_id` holds whichever explicit cursor the request
  named.
- `input_preview` is the newest visible user text of that request (redacted and
  clamped); the session title uses the first record's preview.
- `audit` on the record is flags only (what was captured), not the ciphertext

If two requests that clearly belong together landed in different sessions, check
`session_link` on the second: no explicit cursor, a low-entropy tool call id
(for example `call_0`), a reply shorter than 32 runes, a different access token,
or a client that compacted the history all prevent linking. That is expected,
not a gateway fault.

If `status` is `blocked`, start with the `privacy` event and `privacy_restore`
counts. If the model name looks wrong, start with `routed` and
`requested_model`. If the client saw a 5xx after a delay, compare root `events`
with child retries.
